## üöÄ DEPLOY WEB APP

### Step 1: Connect Railway Service to GitHub

**Important**: The Railway web service must deploy from GitHub, not from local file uploads, to ensure it uses the latest code.

#### Via Railway Dashboard (RECOMMENDED):
1. Open Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/project/9e62407b-8aae-4958-b87f-db206b359006
2. Click on the **"web"** service
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Under **Source** section:
   - Click "Connect Repo" or "Change Source"
   - Select GitHub repository: **Abelhubprog/xHandyWriterz**
   - Set **Root Directory**: `apps/web`
   - Set **Branch**: `main`
   - Enable **Auto Deploy** on push
5. Click **Save**

#### Via Railway CLI (if available):
```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/web
railway link
# Select your project and web service
railway service --repo Abelhubprog/xHandyWriterz --root apps/web
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

The web service needs these environment variables. Set them in Railway Dashboard ‚Üí web service ‚Üí Variables:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_c29vdGhpbmctYmVhY29uLTMwLmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ

# Strapi CMS Connection
VITE_CMS_URL=https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app
VITE_CMS_TOKEN=<your-strapi-api-token-here>

# Optional: Mattermost (if available)
VITE_MATTERMOST_URL=<your-mattermost-url-when-deployed>

# Server Configuration
PORT=4173
NODE_ENV=production
```

**To get VITE_CMS_TOKEN**:
1. Login to Strapi: https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app/admin
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Tokens ‚Üí Create new API Token
3. Name: "Web App Token"
4. Token type: "Full access"
5. Duration: "Unlimited"
6. Copy the token immediately (only shown once!)

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment

After connecting GitHub and setting variables:
1. Railway will automatically deploy from GitHub
2. Or manually trigger: **Settings** ‚Üí **Redeploy**

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check deployment logs
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/web
railway logs -n 50
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ `Starting server on port 4173`
- ‚úÖ `Server is ready and listening`
- ‚ùå No "xdg-open" or "vite preview" errors

### Step 5: Test the Web App

Visit your Railway domain (check Railway Dashboard ‚Üí web service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains):
- Test homepage loads
- Test sign-in with Clerk
- Test dashboard access
- Test Strapi content loads (services/articles pages)
- Test admin panel (requires editor/admin role in Clerk)

## üöÄ DEPLOY MATTERMOST

Mattermost requires PostgreSQL database and R2 storage configuration.

### Architecture Decision Required

Before deploying Mattermost, you need to decide on the architecture:

#### Option A: Docker Compose on Railway
- Deploy Mattermost as a Docker service
- Requires: Railway Docker service + PostgreSQL database
- More control over configuration
- Better for custom integrations

#### Option B: Managed Mattermost
- Use Mattermost Cloud or third-party hosting
- Simpler to manage
- Less configuration required
- Monthly subscription cost

### Recommended: Option A - Railway Docker Deployment

#### Step 1: Prepare Mattermost Configuration

The Mattermost config is ready in: `apps/mattermost/config/mattermost.json`

Key settings already configured:
- PostgreSQL connection
- S3 (Cloudflare R2) file storage
- OIDC placeholders for Clerk SSO

#### Step 2: Create Railway Service for Mattermost

```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/mattermost
railway service create mattermost
railway link
# Select the mattermost service
```

#### Step 3: Create Dockerfile for Mattermost

Create `apps/mattermost/Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM mattermost/mattermost-team-edition:latest

# Copy custom configuration
COPY config/mattermost.json /mattermost/config/config.json

# Set environment variables
ENV MM_CONFIG=/mattermost/config/config.json
ENV MM_SQLSETTINGS_DATASOURCE=${DATABASE_URL}
ENV MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3ACCESSKEYID=${R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
ENV MM_FILESETTINGS_AMAZONS3SECRETACCESSKEY=${R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8065

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=120s \
  CMD wget -q --spider http://localhost:8065/api/v4/system/ping || exit 1

# Start Mattermost
CMD ["/mattermost/bin/mattermost"]
```

#### Step 4: Set Mattermost Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí mattermost service ‚Üí Variables:

```bash
# Database (Create PostgreSQL service first)
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql-connection-string>

# Cloudflare R2 Storage
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-r2-access-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-r2-secret-key>
R2_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_BUCKET=mattermost-uploads

# Mattermost Configuration
MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=https://<your-mattermost-railway-domain>
MM_SERVICESETTINGS_ENABLEOAUTHSERVICEPROVIDER=true

# Clerk OIDC (for SSO) - To be configured
# MM_GITLABSETTINGS_ENABLE=false
# MM_OFFICE365SETTINGS_ENABLE=false

# Admin Account
MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<secure-password>
MM_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@handywriterz.com
```

#### Step 5: Create PostgreSQL Database for Mattermost

Option 1: Use Railway PostgreSQL service
```bash
railway service create postgres-mattermost
```

Option 2: Use Strapi's existing PostgreSQL (NOT RECOMMENDED - separate concerns)

#### Step 6: Deploy Mattermost

```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/mattermost
railway up --detach
```

#### Step 7: Verify Mattermost Deployment

```bash
railway logs -n 50
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ `Server is listening on :8065`
- ‚úÖ `Started Server`
- ‚úÖ Database migrations completed

#### Step 8: Initial Mattermost Setup

1. Visit Mattermost URL (check Railway Dashboard ‚Üí mattermost service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains)
2. Create admin account (if not auto-created)
3. Create team: "HandyWriterz"
4. Create channels:
   - General
   - Support
   - Orders
   - Notifications

#### Step 9: Connect Mattermost to Web App

After Mattermost is running:
1. Get the Mattermost URL from Railway
2. Update web service environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_MATTERMOST_URL=https://<mattermost-railway-domain>
   ```
3. Redeploy web service to pick up the new variable

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Web App Still Shows "xdg-open" Error

**Cause**: Railway is using cached build or old code

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure service is connected to GitHub (not using `railway up`)
2. Check `package.json` has `"start": "node scripts/server.mjs"`
3. Force redeploy: Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Redeploy
4. Check build logs for `pnpm run build` success

### Web App Shows "Cannot connect to CMS"

**Cause**: Missing or incorrect `VITE_CMS_URL` or `VITE_CMS_TOKEN`

**Solutions**:
1. Verify environment variables are set
2. Generate new API token in Strapi if needed
3. Check Strapi is running and accessible
4. Test Strapi API: `curl https://<strapi-url>/api/services`

### Mattermost Won't Start

**Cause**: Missing database or R2 credentials

**Solutions**:
1. Verify PostgreSQL database is running
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
3. Verify R2 credentials are correct
4. Check Mattermost logs: `railway logs -n 100`

### Admin Panel Access Denied

**Cause**: User doesn't have admin/editor role in Clerk

**Solutions**:
1. Login to Clerk Dashboard
2. Go to Users ‚Üí Select user
3. Edit public metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```
4. Save and refresh web app

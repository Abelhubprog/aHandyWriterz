# üéâ SUCCESS - Strapi Admin Login Fixed!

**Date:** October 3, 2025, 15:03 UTC  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### The Issue
For multiple days, you couldn't log into Strapi admin because:
```
error: Cannot send secure cookie over unencrypted connection
http: POST /admin/login ‚Üí 500
```

### The Root Cause
Strapi's underlying Koa framework wasn't configured to trust Railway's HTTPS proxy headers (`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`), so it thought the connection was insecure and refused to send authentication cookies.

### The Solution
Added explicit Koa proxy configuration in `apps/strapi/config/server.ts`:
```typescript
if (enableProxy) {
  serverConfig.proxy = {
    enabled: true,
    koa: {
      proxy: true,                      // Trust Railway's proxy headers
      proxyIpHeader: 'X-Forwarded-For',
      maxIpsCount: 1,
    },
  };
}
```

This makes Koa trust Railway's `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` header and properly detect HTTPS connections.

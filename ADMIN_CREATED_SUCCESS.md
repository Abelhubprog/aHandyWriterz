## üìù What Was Fixed

### The Original Problem
You were seeing "You cannot register a new super admin" because:
1. The HTTPS cookie issue prevented proper admin registration
2. The registration form kept saying an admin already exists
3. But no admin was actually created in the database

### The Solution
1. ‚úÖ Fixed HTTPS configuration by setting `URL` environment variable
2. ‚úÖ Verified no admin users existed with `admin:reset-user-password` (it said "User not found")
3. ‚úÖ Created admin using `npx strapi admin:create-user` command via SSH
4. ‚úÖ Admin user now active and ready to use

### How It Was Done
```bash
# Linked to Strapi service
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/strapi
railway service handywriterz-production

# Created admin user via SSH
railway ssh "npx strapi admin:create-user --email=abelngeno1@gmail.com --password=dunnyYOH#9 --firstname=ABEL --lastname=NGENO"

# Output: Successfully created new admin
```

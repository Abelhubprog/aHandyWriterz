# üî¥ URGENT: Reset Admin Password Now

## The Situation
- ‚úÖ HTTPS fix is deployed and working
- ‚ùå You see "You cannot register a new super admin" 
- üéØ **Why?** An admin user already exists from previous failed attempts

## üöÄ QUICK FIX (3 Steps)

### Option 1: Use Railway Dashboard (EASIEST)

1. **Go to**: https://railway.app/project/9e62407b-8aae-4958-b87f-db206b359006
2. Click on **Postgres** service
3. Click **Data** tab (or **Connect** tab)
4. Look for **Query** or **Console** button
5. Paste and run:
```sql
UPDATE admin_users 
SET password = '$2b$10$GWbEGx4edLkt1enf03WwZOZPVqilSrS2Eg7KxxVxjjgnouStrfMQy',
    is_active = true,
    blocked = false
WHERE email = 'abelngeno1@gmail.com';
```

6. **Login here**: https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app/admin
   - Email: `abelngeno1@gmail.com`
   - Password: `dunnyYOH#9`

---

### Option 2: Use Terminal (if Option 1 doesn't work)

Run this batch file I created:
```batch
d:\HandyWriterzNEW\reset-admin-now.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/strapi
railway service Postgres
railway connect
```

Then paste this SQL:
```sql
UPDATE admin_users 
SET password = '$2b$10$GWbEGx4edLkt1enf03WwZOZPVqilSrS2Eg7KxxVxjjgnouStrfMQy',
    is_active = true,
    blocked = false
WHERE email = 'abelngeno1@gmail.com';

-- Verify it worked
SELECT id, email, is_active FROM admin_users WHERE email = 'abelngeno1@gmail.com';
```

Type `\q` to exit psql.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Email not found"
Run this to see all admin users:
```sql
SELECT id, email, firstname, lastname FROM admin_users;
```

Then use the correct email in the UPDATE command.

### "Still getting cookie error"
The HTTPS fix is deployed. Make sure you're using:
- ‚úÖ https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app/admin
- ‚ùå NOT http://0.0.0.0:8080/admin

### "Cannot connect to Railway"
Make sure you're logged in:
```bash
railway whoami
```

If not logged in:
```bash
railway login
```

## üìù What Just Happened

1. **The Problem**: When you tried to register admin via HTTP, it created a partial admin record
2. **The Fix**: We're directly updating that admin record's password using bcrypt hash
3. **The Password**: `dunnyYOH#9` is hashed to `$2b$10$GWbEGx4edLkt1enf03WwZOZPVqilSrS2Eg7KxxVxjjgnouStrfMQy`
4. **After Login**: Change this temporary password immediately!

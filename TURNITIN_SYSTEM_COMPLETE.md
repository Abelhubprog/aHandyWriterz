## 🎓 Training Notes for Team

### **For Developers**:
- Email templates use React-Email format (HTML strings with inline CSS)
- File validation happens client-side AND should be server-side
- R2 presigned URLs are time-limited - don't cache them
- Payment methods can be added/removed easily in `PaymentGateway.tsx`

### **For Admins**:
- Access reports page at `/admin/turnitin-reports`
- Search orders by ID (check confirmation emails for order ID)
- Upload PDFs only (system validates file type)
- Users receive emails automatically - no manual notification needed

### **For Support**:
- If user doesn't receive submission email, check spam folder
- Payment confirmation emails sent after payment success only
- Reports ready email includes 30-day download links
- Order IDs stored in localStorage (key: `turnitin:{orderId}`)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Stripe/Paystack**: Falls back to StableLink (full integration pending)
2. **Coinbase Commerce**: Redirects to URL (API integration pending)
3. **Order Persistence**: Uses localStorage (should move to backend database)
4. **Email Fallback**: Console logs in development (requires VITE_RESEND_API_KEY for production)
5. **File Size**: Limited to 10MB per file (R2 worker configuration)

---

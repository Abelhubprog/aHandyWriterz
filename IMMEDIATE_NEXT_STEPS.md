## üöÄ YOUR NEXT STEPS (In Order)

### Step 1: Set Admin Role in Clerk (5 minutes)

**You need to do this FIRST before testing admin login!**

1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Click **"Users"** in the left sidebar
3. Find and click **your user account**
4. Click the **"Metadata"** tab
5. Click **"Edit"** next to "Public Metadata"
6. Add this JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```
7. Click **"Save"**
8. Done! ‚úÖ

**Why this is needed:** The admin login now checks `publicMetadata.role === 'admin'` using Clerk. Without this, you'll be redirected to the regular dashboard.

---

### Step 2: Test Admin Login (2 minutes)

1. Open your web app: http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/auth/admin-login
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - If not logged in: Clerk SignIn appears
   - Sign in with your Clerk account
   - Should see toast: "Admin access verified. Redirecting to dashboard..."
   - Should redirect to: http://localhost:5173/admin
   - AdminDashboard should load

4. **If it doesn't work:**
   - Check Clerk metadata (step 1)
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify you're using the account that has admin role
   - Try clearing cookies and signing in again

---

### Step 3: Start Local Services (Optional but Recommended)

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Web app running (localhost:5173)
- ‚ùå Strapi not running (localhost:1337) - **VITE_CMS_TOKEN is empty**
- ‚ùå Upload broker not running (localhost:8787) - **Causes "Upload broker not configured" error**
- ‚ùå Mattermost not running (localhost:8065) - **Causes "Please wait for Mattermost connection" warning**

**Option A: Run All Services Locally**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Strapi CMS
cd apps/strapi
npm install
npm run develop
# Once started, go to http://localhost:1337/admin
# Create admin account, generate API token
# Add token to apps/web/.env: VITE_CMS_TOKEN=your_token

# Terminal 2: Upload Broker (Cloudflare Worker)
cd workers/upload-broker
npm install
wrangler dev --port 8787
# Requires Cloudflare account + R2 setup

# Terminal 3: Mattermost (Docker)
docker run -d \
  --name mattermost \
  -p 8065:8065 \
  -e MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065 \
  mattermost/mattermost-preview

# Terminal 4: Web App (restart to load new env vars)
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

**Option B: Disable Services Temporarily**

If you just want to test admin login without setting up all services:

```bash
cd apps/web

# Edit .env file:
# Comment out or remove:
# VITE_CMS_URL=http://localhost:1337
# VITE_CMS_TOKEN=
# VITE_UPLOAD_BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
# VITE_MATTERMOST_URL=http://localhost:8065

# Or set feature flags:
VITE_ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD=false
VITE_ENABLE_MESSAGING=false
VITE_ENABLE_STRAPI_CONTENT=false

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

---

### Step 4: Deploy to Railway (When Ready)

**Follow the comprehensive guide:** `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Quick Deploy (Web App Only):**
```bash
cd apps/web

# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Create project
railway init

# Set minimal env vars
railway variables set VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your-key"
railway variables set VITE_ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD="false"
railway variables set VITE_ENABLE_MESSAGING="false"
railway variables set VITE_ENABLE_STRAPI_CONTENT="false"

# Deploy
railway up

# Get your URL
railway domain
```

**Then add services one by one:**
1. First deploy web app (works standalone)
2. Then deploy Strapi (if you want CMS)
3. Then deploy upload broker to Cloudflare Workers
4. Then deploy Mattermost (if you want chat)

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Admin Login Not Working?

**Check 1:** Did you set admin role in Clerk?
```
Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Your User ‚Üí Metadata
Add: { "role": "admin" }
```

**Check 2:** Are you using the right Clerk account?
- Log out completely
- Log in with the account that has admin role

**Check 3:** Check browser console
```
F12 ‚Üí Console tab
Look for errors related to Clerk or authentication
```

**Check 4:** Verify .env has Clerk key
```
cd apps/web
cat .env | grep CLERK
# Should see: VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
```

### Upload Broker Error?

**Solution 1:** Disable file uploads temporarily
```
Edit apps/web/.env:
VITE_ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD=false

Restart dev server
```

**Solution 2:** Start upload broker
```
cd workers/upload-broker
npm install
wrangler dev --port 8787
```

### Mattermost Warning?

**Solution 1:** Disable messaging temporarily
```
Edit apps/web/.env:
VITE_ENABLE_MESSAGING=false

Restart dev server
```

**Solution 2:** Start Mattermost
```
docker run -d --name mattermost -p 8065:8065 mattermost/mattermost-preview
```

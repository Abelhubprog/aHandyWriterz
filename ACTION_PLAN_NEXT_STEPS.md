## 🔴 URGENT: Do These First (Next 10 Minutes)

### 1. Change Your Password

**Steps:**
1. You're already logged in ✅
2. Click your profile circle (top right, "AN")
3. Click "Profile settings"
4. Enter:
   - Current password: `dunnyYOH#9`
   - New password: [Strong password - save in password manager]
   - Confirm new password
5. Click "Save"

### 2. Generate API Token
**Why:** Web app needs this to fetch content from Strapi

**Steps:**
1. Click Settings ⚙️ (left sidebar)
2. Click "API Tokens" (under GLOBAL SETTINGS)
3. Click "Create new API Token" button
4. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `Web App Production Token`
   - **Description:** `Token for HandyWriterz web application to fetch content`
   - **Token type:** `Full access` (select from dropdown)
   - **Token duration:** `Unlimited` (or `90 days` if you prefer rotation)
5. Click "Save"
6. **IMMEDIATELY COPY THE TOKEN** - You'll only see it once!
   - Copy to a safe place (password manager or secure note)

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY: Do These Today

### 3. Configure Web App with API Token

**Open:** `apps/web/.env.local` (create if doesn't exist)

**Add:**
```bash
# Strapi CMS Configuration
VITE_CMS_URL=https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app
VITE_CMS_TOKEN=paste-your-token-here-from-step-2
```

**Test:**
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 and verify CMS content loads.

### 4. Check Content Types Exist

**In Strapi Admin:**
1. Click "Content Manager" (left sidebar)
2. Under COLLECTION TYPES, you should see:
   - 📄 **Article** (for blog posts, news)
   - 🛠️ **Service** (for services you offer)

**If missing:** You may need to create them or restore from backup.

### 5. Create Test Content

**Create a test service:**
1. Content Manager → Service → Create new entry
2. Fill in:
   - Title: "Test Service"
   - Description: "This is a test"
   - Slug: "test-service"
3. Click "Save"
4. Click "Publish"

**Create a test article:**
1. Content Manager → Article → Create new entry
2. Fill in basic details
3. Save and Publish

## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Do This Week

### 6. Review Admin Users
1. Settings → Administration Panel → Users
2. You should see 2 users:
   - abelngeno1@gmail.com (you, Super Admin)
   - handywriterz@gmail.com
3. Decide if you need both accounts
4. Disable or delete unused accounts

### 7. Configure Media Library
1. Click "Media Library" (left sidebar)
2. Try uploading a test image
3. Verify upload works
4. Check file appears in library

### 8. Test Full Content Workflow
1. Create draft article
2. Preview draft (if preview feature enabled)
3. Edit content
4. Publish
5. Verify appears on web app

### 9. Set Up Content Permissions
1. Settings → Users & Permissions Plugin → Roles
2. Review "Public" role (what unauthenticated users can access)
3. Review "Authenticated" role (logged-in users)
4. Adjust permissions as needed

---

## 🔵 LOW PRIORITY: Do When Ready

### 10. Clean Up Environment Variables
**In Railway Dashboard:**
1. Go to project variables
2. Can safely remove (no longer used):
   - `ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`
   - `ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=none`
3. These are now handled by default middleware

### 11. Set Up Backups
Consider setting up:
- PostgreSQL backups (Railway has automatic backups)
- Content export schedule
- Media library backup to separate storage

### 12. Deploy Web App to Production
Once CMS integration is tested locally:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, etc.)
```

### 13. Documentation
- Update project README with deployment info
- Document content type schemas
- Create content creation guide for editors

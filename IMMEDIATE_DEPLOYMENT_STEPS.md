# üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - Deploy Web App & Mattermost

## ‚úÖ What's Done
1. All code committed to GitHub: https://github.com/Abelhubprog/xHandyWriterz
2. Strapi is LIVE: https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app ‚úÖ
3. Web app code is ready with:
   - Production HTTP server (no xdg-open error)
   - Improved admin layout with Strapi/Mattermost quick links
   - Clerk authentication integration
   - Strapi content fetching
4. Mattermost configuration is prepared in `apps/mattermost/`

## üéØ YOUR ACTION: Deploy Web App

### Step 1: Connect Railway to GitHub (5 minutes)

**The web app is currently failing because Railway is using cached builds from local uploads. It MUST deploy from GitHub instead.**

1. **Open Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/project/9e62407b-8aae-4958-b87f-db206b359006

2. **Click on "web" service**

3. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Source**:
   - Click "Connect Repo" or "Change Source"
   - Select: **Abelhubprog/xHandyWriterz**
   - Root Directory: **apps/web**
   - Branch: **main**
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Deploy on Push"

4. **Click Save**

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables (3 minutes)

Still in Railway Dashboard ‚Üí web service ‚Üí **Variables** tab:

```bash
# Required - Clerk Authentication
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_c29vdGhpbmctYmVhY29uLTMwLmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ

# Required - Strapi CMS
VITE_CMS_URL=https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app

# Required - Get this from Strapi (see below)
VITE_CMS_TOKEN=<PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>

# Optional - Server port
PORT=4173

# Optional - Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Get VITE_CMS_TOKEN:
1. Login to Strapi: https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app/admin
   - Email: `abelngeno1@gmail.com`
   - Password: `dunnyYOH#9` (CHANGE THIS IMMEDIATELY!)
2. Settings ‚Üí API Tokens ‚Üí Create new API Token
3. Name: "Web App Production"
4. Type: "Full access"
5. Duration: "Unlimited"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (only shown once!)
7. Paste into Railway Variables

### Step 3: Deploy (1 minute)

After connecting GitHub and setting variables:
- Railway will automatically deploy
- OR click **Settings** ‚Üí **Redeploy**

### Step 4: Verify (2 minutes)

Check Railway logs:
```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/web
railway logs -n 50
```

‚úÖ Should see:
- `Starting server on port 4173`
- `Server is ready and listening`

‚ùå Should NOT see:
- `vite preview`
- `xdg-open ENOENT`

### Step 5: Test (5 minutes)

Visit your Railway web app domain:
1. Homepage loads ‚úì
2. Click "Sign In" ‚Üí Clerk login works ‚úì
3. After login ‚Üí Dashboard appears ‚úì
4. Navigate to "Services" ‚Üí Content from Strapi loads ‚úì
5. If you have admin role ‚Üí Admin panel accessible ‚úì

## üöÄ OPTIONAL: Deploy Mattermost

**Only do this after the web app is working!**

See detailed instructions in: **DEPLOY_WEB_AND_MATTERMOST.md**

Quick overview:
1. Create PostgreSQL database for Mattermost
2. Create Railway service for Mattermost
3. Create Dockerfile (template provided in docs)
4. Set environment variables (DB, R2, admin credentials)
5. Deploy with `railway up`
6. Update web app with `VITE_MATTERMOST_URL`

## üêõ If Web App Still Fails

### Issue: Still seeing "xdg-open" error

**Cause**: Railway not deploying from GitHub

**Fix**:
1. Double-check GitHub is connected (Step 1)
2. Make sure Root Directory is set to `apps/web`
3. Click "Redeploy" button in Railway Dashboard
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

### Issue: "Cannot connect to CMS"

**Cause**: Missing API token

**Fix**:
1. Generate API token in Strapi (see Step 2)
2. Add to Railway Variables as `VITE_CMS_TOKEN`
3. Redeploy web service

### Issue: Admin panel shows "Access Denied"

**Cause**: Your Clerk user doesn't have admin role

**Fix**:
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Find your user
3. Edit Public Metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```
4. Save and refresh web app

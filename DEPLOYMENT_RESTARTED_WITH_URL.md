# 🔄 FIXED: Deployment Restarted with URL Variable

**Date**: October 3, 2025, 14:08 UTC  
**Status**: ✅ Container restarted with correct HTTPS configuration

---

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

The previous deployment (13:32:36) started **before** we set the `URL` environment variable.

Even though we set `URL=https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app`, the **running container didn't pick it up** because environment variables are only loaded at container startup.

**Result**: You kept getting "Internal Server Error" / "Cannot send secure cookie over unencrypted connection"

---

## ✅ The Fix

**Action Taken**:
```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/strapi
railway up --detach
```

**Result**:
- New deployment: `a66cfa35-6fad-4a61-91a7-53ced888664e`
- Container started: `14:08:43 UTC`
- Status: ✅ Strapi started successfully
- **Now has URL variable loaded!**

---

## 🚀 TRY LOGGING IN NOW

**URL**: https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app/admin

**Credentials**:
- Email: `abelngeno1@gmail.com`
- Password: `dunnyYOH#9`

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Login form loads (no "Internal Server Error")
- ✅ After clicking "Login", you should see the Strapi dashboard
- ✅ No cookie errors in browser console

---

## 🧪 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Verify the URL is Really Being Used

```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/strapi
railway ssh "printenv | grep URL"
```

Should show:
```
URL=https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app
RAILWAY_STATIC_URL=handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app
```

### Check 2: Look at Server Logs During Login

```bash
railway logs -n 20
```

Look for:
- ❌ BAD: "Failed to create admin refresh session Cannot send secure cookie"
- ✅ GOOD: `POST /admin/login (XX ms) 200`

### Check 3: Browser Console (F12)

1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Try logging in
3. Check for:
   - ❌ BAD: Cookie-related errors
   - ✅ GOOD: Successful API responses

---

## 🔐 After Successful Login

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Change Password**:
   - Profile icon (top right) → Settings → Profile
   - Change password to something secure
   - Save

2. **Generate API Token**:
   - Settings → API Tokens
   - Create new token: "Web App Production"
   - Full access
   - Copy and save the token

3. **Test Content Creation**:
   - Content Manager → Create new Service or Article
   - Save as draft
   - Verify it works

## 📊 Deployment Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| 13:32:36 | First deployment (without URL) | ❌ Cookie errors |
| 13:59:51 | Admin user created via SSH | ✅ Success |
| 14:00:00 | Set URL environment variable | ✅ Success |
| 14:01:07 | Login attempts (old container) | ❌ Still failing |
| 14:08:43 | **NEW: Redeployed with URL** | ✅ Should work now |

---

## 🎯 Environment Status

### Current Configuration ✅
```env
# Strapi knows its public URL
URL=https://handywriterz-production-production.up.railway.app

# Trust Railway's proxy
ENABLE_PROXY=true

# Secure cookies over HTTPS
ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=none

# Database connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:***@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway

# All secrets set (12 variables)
APP_KEYS=...
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=...
# etc.
```

### Why This Works Now
1. `URL` variable tells Strapi: "Your public address is https://..."
2. `ENABLE_PROXY=true` tells Strapi: "Trust the X-Forwarded-Proto header from Railway"
3. Together, these make Strapi treat incoming requests as HTTPS
4. `ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` is satisfied because requests are "secure"
5. Login cookies work properly! 🎉

---

## 🆘 Emergency Fallback

If login **still** fails after the new deployment, we can temporarily disable secure cookies:

```bash
cd d:/HandyWriterzNEW/apps/strapi
railway variables --set "ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false"
railway up --detach
```

**⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED** - only use as last resort for testing, then re-enable immediately after login.

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Environment variables only load at container startup** - setting them doesn't affect running containers
2. **Railway doesn't auto-restart** when env vars change - you must manually redeploy
3. **The `railway up` command** triggers a new build and deployment with current env vars
4. **Admin creation worked** because it ran via SSH on the running container (didn't need URL variable)
5. **Login requires HTTPS** configuration to be properly set at startup

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

Once you login successfully:

1. [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
2. [ ] Left sidebar shows all sections (Content Manager, Media Library, Settings, etc.)
3. [ ] No console errors (F12)
4. [ ] Can navigate between pages
5. [ ] Can change password
6. [ ] Can generate API token
7. [ ] Can create test content

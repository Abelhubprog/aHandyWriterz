# 🚨 STRAPI START COMMAND FIX - Step by Step

## What I See in Your Screenshot

✅ **Build Command is set**: `cd apps/strapi && npm run start`
❌ **Problem**: That's the BUILD command, but you also need a START command

## The Issue

Railway has **TWO separate fields**:
1. **Build Command** - Runs during build (like `npm run build`)
2. **Start Command** - Runs to start the server (like `npm run start`)

**You set the start command in the BUILD field!** That's why it still says "No start command was found."

## ✅ CORRECT Configuration for Strapi

In Railway Dashboard → **handywriterz-production** service → **Settings**:

### Build Section:
- **Build Command**: 
  ```
  cd apps/strapi && npm run build
  ```

### Deploy Section (scroll down from Build):
- **Start Command**: 
  ```
  cd apps/strapi && npm run start
  ```

## 📋 Exact Steps to Fix Right Now

1. **Stay in the Settings tab** you're already in
2. **Scroll down** past the Build section
3. You'll see a **Deploy** section with these fields:
   - Number of Replicas
   - Restart Policy
   - **Start Command** ← THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED!
   - Health Check Path
   - Health Check Timeout
4. **Click in the Start Command field**
5. **Type exactly**:
   ```
   cd apps/strapi && npm run start
   ```
6. **Click outside the field** to save (auto-saves)
7. **Go back to Build section** and fix Build Command:
   ```
   cd apps/strapi && npm run build
   ```

## 🎯 What Each Command Does

**Build Command** (runs once during deployment):
```bash
cd apps/strapi && npm run build
# This compiles Strapi admin panel and prepares static files
```

**Start Command** (runs to keep server running):
```bash
cd apps/strapi && npm run start
# This starts the Strapi server on port 1337
```

## 📸 What to Look For

After you set **Start Command** in the Deploy section, the deployment logs should show:

```
✅ Build phase completed
✅ Starting deployment...
✅ Running start command: cd apps/strapi && npm run start
✅ Server listening on port 1337
✅ Deployment successful
```

## 🔍 If You Can't Find "Start Command" Field

If scrolling doesn't show a Deploy section with Start Command:

1. Look for **"Custom Start Command"** or **"Run Command"**
2. Or try the **Variables** tab and add:
   ```
   RAILWAY_RUN_COMMAND=cd apps/strapi && npm run start
   ```

## ⚡ Quick Verification

After setting both commands:
- **Build Logs tab** should show the build command executing
- **Deploy Logs tab** should show the start command executing
- **HTTP Logs tab** should show incoming requests

---

**TL;DR**: You put the start command in the wrong field! There are TWO fields:
- Build Command = `cd apps/strapi && npm run build`
- Start Command = `cd apps/strapi && npm run start` ← You need to find and set THIS ONE

Scroll down in Settings to find the Start Command field in the Deploy section!
